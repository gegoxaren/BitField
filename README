/*
 * The basic concept of a bitmap is to provide some kind of siple storrage of
 * information, that should not take too much space.
 *
 * The basic way of doing this is using something like uint8 or uint16,
 * which provides us with up to 8 and 16 fields respectivly, with the simplest
 * field being 1 bit, up to the one-field type having the full 8bit (256 value)
 * or 16bit (65535 value) to work with in one field.
 *
 * When defining a bitmap type you need to consider what fields you need, how
 * many values each feald sholud have and how they corrolate to your data.
 *
 * Lits take the examlpe of a simple game map, where you have information like
 * if a tile is travelsable or if only cetain
